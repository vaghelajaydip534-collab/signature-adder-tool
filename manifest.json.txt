This project provides a solid foundation for the Signature Adder Tool. The HTML is semantic, the CSS is organized with a dark mode, and the JavaScript is vanilla and handles the core functionalities. The `README.md` provides clear instructions for use and future development. The additional pages and assets are structured as requested, making for a complete and professional static website.
